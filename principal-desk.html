					It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Polytechnic College (BBSBPC); an aesthetically designed and elegantly built eco-friendly campus furnished with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. The Institute presently offers the 3-year Diploma programs in following streams: Automobile Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics & Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. For higher studies, Diploma is equivalent to +2 Senior Secondary Examination of the Punjab Board. At BBSBPC, education is not only focusing on Diploma course but also creating a platform for the students to realize their dreams, hone their cognition, sharpen their competence and carve out a wholesome personality.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Technical Education is the backbone of every nation and is the stepping stone for a country to move into the category of a developed nation. The institute has well equipped labs, workshops and libraries to help students in attaining highest standards in academics and professional skills. The academic activities concentrate on helping the students to gain an excellent theoretical knowledge base. The accomplished team of lecturers groom and guide students to the best of their capacity. Students are encouraged to conduct practical sessions themselves under strict supervision of faculty members. The campus has adequate sports infrastructure to take care of sports and recreational activities. The motivating environment in BBSBPC for knowledge assimilation, generation and dissemination with a sense of social responsibility, human values and concern for social commitment, has carved a niche for itself among the best technical institutes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Industrial visits are also arranged for the students to face the challenges of future posed by global changes with confidence. The institute offers hostel facilities for both boys and girls with mess facility. Anti–Ragging measures/initiatives are put in place well before commencement of the session in order to ensure free and fearless movement of students in the campus. A large number of CCTV cameras have been installed at all critical places which are vulnerable to ragging.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Finally, the sole vision of Panth Rattan Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, who established the BBSB Education Trust, is being preserved and carried forward in a rightful way by the highly dedicated and able management. The main focus of the Institution is to empower students with sound knowledge, wisdom, experience and training, both at the academic level of Engineering and in the highly competitive global industrial market. I wish all my students and faculty a successful and rewarding career.
