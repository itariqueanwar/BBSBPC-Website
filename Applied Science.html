The assets of the chemistry lab include modern instruments which are in accordance with latest industry requirement trends. Students are made to work on latest experiments which are directly related to industry.
				<br><br>
				Applied Physics includes the study of diverse topics, all related to things that go on in the world around us. It aims to give an understanding of this world both by observing and by prediction of the way in which objects will behave. Concrete use of physical principles and analysis in various fields of engineering and technology are given prominence in the course content. The physics lab acquaints with the experiments based upon the fundamentals they learn in theory and in the lab they acquire by performing. The lab is adorned with the best infrastructure and apparatus.
				<br><br>
				Language is the most commonly used and effective medium of self-expression in all spheres of human life personal, social and professional.
